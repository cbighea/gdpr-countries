# gdpr-countries
A list of countries subjected to GDPR legislation, listed as ISO 3166 Alpha-2 & Alpha-3 codes. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes for reference.

This list may not be completely accurate, but contrary to popular belief, GDPR is not just for EU-countries. While the UK has left the EU, it still keeps GDPR, as well as some (but not all) of its territories. There are also EEA countries like Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway which are subject to GDPR but not part of the EU.
